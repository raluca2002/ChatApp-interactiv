Real Time Chat Project

This project is a real-time chat application that allows communication between two users via a chat platform. Real-time communication is supported by Socket.io, and for the frontend we used Bootstrap, while for the backend we have Node.js and for the database we use MongoDB.

Features

Registration and Login: Users can register using their name, email address and password. This information is automatically saved in the database. After registration, users can log in to their account by logging in with their email and password.
Real Time Chat: Users can communicate with each other in real time. The list of all registered users is displayed at the top under the headerbar. Clicking on a user in the list will open a dedicated chat window with that user.
Notifications: When one user receives a message, the other user will receive a notification to keep them informed of new messages.
Logout: There is a logout option at the top of the headerbar that allows users to log out of their account.
